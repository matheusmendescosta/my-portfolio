I’m tight with TypeScript, and lately, I’ve been low-key vibing with Python – feels like it might be turning into a full-on thing.\nOn my blog, I keep it real with dev stories, wins, and the occasional “what the heck just happened?” moments. If you’re down for the ride, swing by and check it out! ✌️"
